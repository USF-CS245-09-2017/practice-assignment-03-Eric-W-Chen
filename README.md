# CS245 - Practice Assignment 3

There are three search implementations in this assignment: Linear, Binary Iterative, and Binary Recursive. The fastest is binary iterative with an average search time of 1.9E-4ms, the second fastest is binary recursive with an average time of 2.8E-4ms, and the slowest is linear search with an average time of 0.01911 ms. I just implemented the algorithms we solved in class to complete this assignment.
